# Difference-Between-Two-Fuzzy-Sets
A program to demonstrate the Difference Between Two Fuzzy Sets

# Formula :

###  A | B = A n complement_of_B

### where A and B are fuzzy sets and n ==> Intersection

# What is a Fuzzy Set ??

There are 2 terms we need to understand before understanding fuzzy set i.e. fuzzy and crisp

1. fuzzy : Fuzzy means the things whose answers are not perfect or not specific.
  eg. How good player Virat Kohli is ?? 
  some say, he is best , some say good , some say average. 
 
2. crisp : Crisp means value should be perfect and accurate.
  eg. How many runs Virat Kohli scored today ??
  runs scored = 113 , so you can't say like he scored a lot of runs or more than 100 runs. Your answer must pe accurate and perfect.

So , 

### fuzzy set is the set of fuzzy values or values that are not specific.

#  Difference Between Two Fuzzy Sets : 

### difference ( A | B ) = ( fuzzy set of A ) n ( complement of fuzzy set B ) 
 
where , n ==> Intersection
